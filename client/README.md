# E-Commerce Website

# Project Overview

This eCommerce project consists of a client-side application and a server-side backend, designed to facilitate online shopping experiences.

# Client-Side

Framework: The client is likely built using React, as indicated by the presence of .jsx files and the src directory containing components and screens.
Components: The client/src/Components/ directory includes various UI components such as Header, ProductsCards, and UI elements like avatar, checkbox, and dialog, which are likely used to build the user interface.
Redux: The presence of a reduxs directory suggests that the application uses Redux for state management, with actions and slices defined for managing application state.
Screens: The Screens directory contains different screens for the application, such as LandingScreen, ProductScreen, and ProductsScreen, indicating a structured approach to managing different views in the application.

# Server-Side

Backend: The server-side is likely built with Node.js, as indicated by the presence of index.js and routing files.
Database: The db.js file suggests that the application may connect to a database, possibly for storing product information and user data.
Routing: The router directory contains routes for handling product-related requests, indicating a RESTful API structure for managing product data.
Summary
Overall, this eCommerce project is structured to provide a seamless online shopping experience, with a clear separation between the client and server components. The use of React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, along with Redux for state management, suggests a modern web application architecture aimed at delivering dynamic and responsive user interactions.
